\addchap{Acknowledgments}

I grateful to the participants of many university courses I taught at Freie Universität Berlin and elsewhere (including Göttingen University and Siegen University).
Among the students in my statistics classes, Elizabeth Pankratz, Johanna Rehak, and Samuel Reichert stood out as providing extremely valuable feedback through well-informed, inquisitive, and critical questions.

Also, I would like to thank Felix Bildhauer for an ongoing discussion about statistical methods and their application in linguistics.
This includes the ``Dahlem statistics reading circle'' and a shared repository of books and papers about statistics.

Most prominently, I would like to thank Deborah G.\ Mayo for her work on statistical inference, so far culminating in \citet{Mayo2018}.
Thanks to Mayo's works, I might at least be on the right track now with regard to statistical thinking.
The suspicion lingers, however, that primarily due to my limited understanding and secondarily due to my exposure to the rich literature that propagates mindless statistics and\slash or asinine criticism of statistics, I got a lot of key points and details wrong.

Thus, while a lot of the good stuff that might be found in this book comes from other people, I am the sole source of all errors and misconceptions it contains.
I will make a sincere effort to fix any problems that readers and critics point out in future editions.
